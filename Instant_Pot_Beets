Beets to Perfection

Use this InstantPot for is cooking beets to perfection: just peel, slice into 1/4" to 3/8" thick discs, place on top of the steamer rack over (not in) water, then cook on high pressure for 8 minutes, fast release at the end.
I start the water heating before I begin peeling and slicing the beets, and usually the pot is just about ready to pressurize when I am done slicing.
